# how to install


ppam file: https://github.com/glycoaddict/glycanppt/blob/master/Glycan%20Drawing%20Macro%20v2.ppam


Download the ppam file to your computer. In PowerPoint goto File, Options, drop down box select addins, click Go. 
Click add new and select the ppam file you downloaded. 


It should create a new tab in your office ribbon called Add Ins. Click this tab. To draw glycans click the Toolbox button. You can set the scale to draw then click one of the buttons to draw that sugar. To draw a connected sugar you need to have selected the sugar residue and then click the button to add that sugar. You can then click and drag or use the arrow keys to move the glycan into position. 


Borders will scale according to the size so use the size number to help set the border size. Resize by grouping all your glycans together and drag resize. If you set a big number for scale and then resize down by hand, resizing will not affect border thickness so that's how you can get thicker borders.


FYI each sugar is actually a group of three items: the cartoon autoshape, a tiny autoshape "hidden" behind its center, and a connector joining this hidden autoshape to the hidden autoshape of another residue.
